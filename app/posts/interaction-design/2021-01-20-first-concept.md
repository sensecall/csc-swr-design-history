An initial concept for a tool social workers might use to record assessment notes.

This was put together quickly and used as a prompt for user research and to demonstrate to the SWR team.

### Functionality:

- Basic authentication flow
- Assessment notes main page
- Example page for creating a written note

{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}

{{ appFigure({
	image: {
    file: "../SW recording notes.jpg"
  }
}) }}
